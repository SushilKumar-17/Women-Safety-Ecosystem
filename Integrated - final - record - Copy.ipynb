      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Gender Distribution Analysis:**\n",
      "* **SOS Event Gender Breakdown:** A detailed analysis reveals a significant gender imbalance in SOS call events, with [Percentage]% more incidents reported by women and [Percentage]% of men submitting calls. \n",
      "    * **Women-Initiated Calls:** Women initiated the majority of SOS calls, indicating potential vulnerability requiring further attention.  [Suggest possible explanation for pattern based on available data: e.g., \"women may be reporting security concerns related to domestic violence\"].\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Analysis and Recommendations:**\n",
      "* **Further Investigation Required:** Given the observed gender imbalances in SOS events, we recommend conducting a detailed study of [specific areas where there are gaps in data]. This will help identify potential contributing factors, including [mention possible explanations for this pattern e.g., \"gender-based violence\", \"social inequalities\"]. \n",
      "* **Community Outreach and Safety Programs:** Engaging with vulnerable communities should be prioritized to address specific needs identified through ongoing monitoring.  This can include:\n",
